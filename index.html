        Designing Games for Players</strong></h1>
<h5>
        <!-- Tagline -->
        Games are incomplete without its players, and that can provide a challenge for designers.</h5>

<p class="splash1">There's a certain irony to writing an article about the work behind games, considering how many people play games as an escape from work. <a href="https://www.theesa.com/everyone-plays/">1 in 3 people play games</a>, and in the United States, as much as <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2024-data/">61% of the US population</a> report playing video games for at least one hour every week. The video game market has grown so much, that while it was worth nearly 400 billion last year, it's set to reach a trillion by 2032. It wouldn't be difficult to say that games are a pretty big thing. <br>
</p>
<div id="imageBox"><p class="splash3">And for good reason. Games provide an incredibly immersive experience that a lot of media can't. But, as the demand for games grows, so does the scrutiny and expectation of its audience. I keep hearing from friends that they've sat blankly looking at their full library of games, and feeling like there's nothing they want to play. <br><br>
I've been there too. Often now, I find myself eagerly waiting to hear about <a href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/gamescom-2024-is-a-strong-signal-for-the-industry">the latest new games</a> at events like Gamescom, and repeatedly walking away <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-ps5-pro/">disappointed</a>. If the game market continues to grow at such a pace, why is it so hard to make games? Do game developers really know nothing?</p>

<p class="splash4">Designing games for a global audience doesn't come without its challenges. Players are notoriously unpredictable. They come from different levels of experience, like and dislike vastly different things, and interpret things in very different ways. When you drop them into an unknown world as the main character of your story, who knows what could happen? If you put a door in front of them, you need a reason for them to go through it and even then sometimes they won’t.<br>

</p><h4>  <br>
  It’s impossible to design a game without accounting for its central component: the Player. A good designer needs to account for various players, and still create a particular experience.<br></h4>

<p class="splash5"><br>
Understanding how games do this is called Ludology. Ludology is an incredibly new area of research. It was once part of anthropology as a cultural study of games- one of its earliest notable works being Johan Huizinga’s <em><a href="https://merton.bellarmine.edu/files/original/b0899cfad820ab8ad7033952b7a022ba1d7cab9d.pdf">Homo Ludens (1938)</a></em>. Ludology was only considered its own field after the early 2000s. The term “Ludology” had been tossed around in the 50s and 60s- but gained popularity following 1999, when it was used by Gonzalo Frasca in the Finnish magazine Parnasso.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

  So how does it work? What does Ludology teach designers about players?<br>

  <p class="splash6">To better understand players, we use Game Taxonomies like <em><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Bartle/publication/247190693_Hearts_clubs_diamonds_spades_Players_who_suit_MUDs/links/540058700cf2194bc29ac4f2/Hearts-clubs-diamonds-spades-Players-who-suit-MUDs.pdf">Richard Bartle’s Taxonomy of Players (1996)</a></em>. These are a high-level framework used to better classify what drives different players, and the various strengths of games.</p>
  </div><br><div id="imageBox3">
<p class="splash7">To control the difficulty of a game for players of various skill, <em><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/publication/224927532_Flow_The_Psychology_of_Optimal_Experience/links/55ad6c2f08aed614b097b39e/Flow-The-Psychology-of-Optimal-Experience.pdf">Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory of “Flow” (1990)</a></em> is used in designing interactive experiences, for something called Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="splash8">Overall, my number one recommendation for understanding and learning more about Ludology and the difficulty of designing games would be Greg Costikyan’s “I Have No Words and I Must Design.” Costikyan hones in on the core component of what a game needs to be a game- Meaningful Decision Making. Games are not a puzzle, a toy, or a story- they demand participation. They need goals, opposition, and resources- They need an element to control, and they need information to make those decisions.<br>
  <br>
  However, if you take away anything from this blog, I’d ask it be this— As all designers know, the most important thing games need to have is a Player.</p>

<blockquote><br>
  <div id="quote">&nbsp;"From the outside, game design looks easy. From the outside, writing looks easy, and everyone in Hollywood wants to screw with the script. But actually, this is among the most difficult creative disciplines, precisely because we’re creating structures that people are going to use in every possible way, and use in ways we cannot anticipate. Games are an artform unlike any other, because the product is not passively received, it is not something specified to the last splotch of paint and every comma. Rather, a game, as it is played, is a collaboration between the developers and the players, a journey of mutual discovery, a democratic artform in which the shape of the game is created by the artist, but the experience of the game is created by the player." -Greg Costikyan, I Have No Words and I Must Design</div>
